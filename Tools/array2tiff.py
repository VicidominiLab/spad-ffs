    pxsize      Pixel size [Âµm]
    dim         String with dimensions in image
                    e.g. z stack of planar images: dim = "yxz"
                    The order must be "tzcyxs". The same order must be used
                    for data
                    E.g. for a xy time series: dim="tyx" and 'data' is a 3D
                    array with time, y, and x as 1st, 2nd, and 3r dimension
                    The only exception is that for a 3D array also "yxz" is ok
                    in combination with transpose3=True
                    (which moves the 3rd dimension to the first to correct the
                     order)
